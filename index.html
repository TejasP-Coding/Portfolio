        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Tejas Perna. I was born and raised in Harlem, Manhattan(If you don't know thats in New York City). I am currently a rising senior at Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science and Engineering. I'm also an All Star Code scholar at the moment. All my life, I have been fascinated by STEM and they were my favorite classes. My dream is to be an Aerospace Engineer and hopefully work on spacecraft. Although, coding isn't too shabby either, I even coded this website :). My hobbies include Soccer, Video Games and Chess.</p>
